        to diverse fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge
        and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
        imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began
        to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
        developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom
        .</p>

        as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of
        understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking
        in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. </p>
